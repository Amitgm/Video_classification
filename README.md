# Video_classification

## Information

Background: The CNN LSTM architecture involves using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers for feature extraction on input data combined with LSTMs to support sequence prediction.

CNN LSTMs were developed for visual time series prediction problems and the application of generating textual descriptions from sequences of images (e.g. videos). Specifically, the problems of:

Activity Recognition: Generating a textual description of an activity demonstrated in a sequence of images
Image Description: Generating a textual description of a single image.
Video Description: Generating a textual description of a sequence of images.
Applications: Applications such as surveillance, video retrieval and human-computer interaction require methods for recognizing human actions in various scenarios. In the area of robotics, the tasks of autonomous navigation or social interaction could also take advantage of the knowledge extracted from live video recordings. Typical scenarios include scenes with cluttered, moving backgrounds, nonstationary camera, scale variations, individual variations in appearance and cloth of people, changes in light and view point and so forth. All of these conditions introduce challenging problems that can be addressed using deep learning (computer vision) models.

## Dataset

Dataset: This dataset consists of labelled videos of 6 human actions (walking, jogging, running, boxing, hand waving and hand clapping) performed several times by 25 subjects in four different scenarios: outdoors s1, outdoors with scale variation s2, outdoors with different clothes s3 and indoors s4 as illustrated below.
